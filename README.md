# iRecMagicTV_iOS
MagicTV EasyRecorder is a frontend for the MagicTV iRec web site. 

This project was tried to enter App Store but failed, due to 2 main reasons:

- This project uses resources that has not been legally authorized
- App Store requires to prove actual interactions between real devices with videos

I have determined not to continue trying after several failure attempts and cease development of the project altogether with Android version.

### Basic Information

**Project Language**: Swift 2
**Project Version**: Xcode 7
**Validity**: The project is usable at time of development, but since Android version still works, iOS version should also works

### License Information

This project is licensed with GNU General Public License V2 with exception of the following:

- Submission to any online platform is prohibited unless obtained express written permission from Studio KUMA
- Commercial usage of any unmodified or derived works are prohibited by any mean

I understand that usage of exception in GPL v2 is not valid legally, but I will do my best to publicize any violators.

### Notes on Ads By Google

This project has Ads By Google built in, however the AdMob Unit ID has been removed from the project so I will not gain any revenue by usage of the code.
